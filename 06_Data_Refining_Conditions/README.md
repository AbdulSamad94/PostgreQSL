# PostgreSQL Data Refining Practice

This folder contains SQL practice queries focused on **data refining** using common clauses.

## File

- **data_refining.sql**  
  Demonstrates usage of key SQL clauses with the `Employees` table.

## Clauses Covered

1. **WHERE** – Filter rows using relational, logical, or special operators (`IN`, `NOT IN`, `BETWEEN`).
2. **DISTINCT** – Return only unique values.
3. **ORDER BY** – Sort rows in ascending (default) or descending order.
4. **LIMIT** – Restrict the number of rows returned.
5. **LIKE** – Perform pattern matching with `%` (any length) and `_` (single character).

## How to Use

Run the queries one by one in a PostgreSQL client like `psql` or any SQL editor (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin) to observe the results.
